This is a quiz app.

It runs with 10 random questions to answer with true or false by clicking on the corresponding buttons. (check mark is true, cross mark is false)

The questions are called through an API from open trivia.

After answer all questions, your score is displayed and you can either choose to restart the same quiz with the same answers or start a quiz with a new set of questions.
